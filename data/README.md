Here we have example of preprocessed geometrical data for slanted barrier problem. The barrier is at ~20 degree angle.

For instance, we have the number of small cells, index location of the small cells, area of the small cells, the side lengths of the small cells, etc.
In this directory the barrier is a line segment whose starting point is (0,0.354) and end point is (1.0,0.711).
